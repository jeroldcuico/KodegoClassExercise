Anna Karenina tells of the doomed love affair 
between the sensuous and rebellious Anna and the 
dashing officer, Count Vronsky. Tragedy unfolds 
as Anna rejects her passionless marriage and must endure 
the hypocrisies of society. Set against a vast and 
richly textured canvas of nineteenth-century Russia, 
the novel's seven major characters create a dynamic 
imbalance, playing out the contrasts of city and 
country life and all the variations on love 
and family happiness.

its contents with profound dispassion, the author of Madame Bovary 
was tried for "offenses against morality and religion." What shocks

woman destroyed by the reckless pursuit of her romantic dreams is 
its pure artistry: the poise of its narrative structure, the opulence 
of its prose (marvelously captured in the English translation of 
Francis Steegmuller), and its creation of a world whose minor 
figures are as vital as its doomed heroine.
