          Anna Karenina tells of the doomed love affair between the sensuous and
          rebellious Anna and the dashing officer, Count Vronsky. Tragedy
          unfolds as Anna rejects her passionless marriage and must endure the
          hypocrisies of society. Set against a vast and richly textured canvas
          of nineteenth-century Russia, the novel's seven major characters
          create a dynamic imbalance, playing out the contrasts of city and
          country life and all the variations on love and family happiness.

        <td>
          For daring to peer into the heart of an adulteress and enumerate its
          contents with profound dispassion, the author of Madame Bovary was
          tried for "offenses against morality and religion." What shocks us
          today about Flaubert's devastatingly realized tale of a young woman
          destroyed by the reckless pursuit of her romantic dreams is its pure
          artistry: the poise of its narrative structure, the opulence of its
          prose (marvelously captured in the English translation of Francis
          Steegmuller), and its creation of a world whose minor figures are as
          vital as its doomed heroine.

          Epic in scale, War and Peace delineates in graphic detail events
          leading up to Napoleon's invasion of Russia, and the impact of the
          Napoleonic era on Tsarist society, as seen through the eyes of five
          Russian aristocratic families.
